Review Jack syntax and make sure that I know what I'm working with
Get the compiler working so that I can actually test my code

Main.jack
	Initialize a very basic Main class function with no code inside
	Do first two steps of next category
	Call that function from Main.jack, compile and test

Game2048.jack
	Initialize class function (and dispose function)
	Initialize function that prints an int

Sprites.jack
	Initialize class function
	Populate this function with sprites for all tiles up to 2048!
	do Sprites.jack later on when displaying numbers is needed
